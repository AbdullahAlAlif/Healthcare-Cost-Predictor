# Healthcare Cost Predictor

This project is a web application that predicts healthcare costs based on user inputs such as age, BMI, and smoking status. The app uses a machine learning model to make these predictions.

## Features
- **Input Fields**: Users can enter their age, BMI, and smoking status.
- **Interaction Input Fields**:it calculates interactional fields which are age_bmi age_smoker and bmi_smoker  
- **Prediction Display**: The app displays the predicted healthcare cost.
- **MinMax Scaling**: The app internally scales the age and BMI inputs for better prediction accuracy.
- **Regression Algorithm**: The app uses a regression algorithm to predict healthcare costs based on the provided.
